            <h4>About the Website</h4>
            <p>I want this site to be my little corner of the internet (as we all do, c'mon this is neocities). I want to be able to structure my content the way that I want to and have little to no restrictions on what I put on here. I first created this site so that I could dabble around with web development but I also agreed with the general philosophy of the neocities community: make your own prescence on the internet, you don't have to rely on social media. So yeah social media is a disease and fucking sucks ass (looking at you elon (yes i still have a twitter(yes im addicted))) and its only purpose is to keep people on their site for as long as humanly possible through targeted content and algorithms because thats how they make a profit.</p>
            <p>This site mainly contains writing (fanfiction, me ranting about my opinions on topics), projects I've done or am working on, and fan shrines for my interests.</p>
            <p>This site has been through a couple iterations now and I like to think that they get better with each one as I learn what I enjoy for my site. With this current one I wanted to aim for more text-based (but not minimalist) so I can focus on the actual content. I also wanted to work on making a responsive site, and an accessible one.</p>
