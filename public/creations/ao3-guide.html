            <p>I made an Archive of Our Own tutorial/guide on <a href="https://ao3-tutorial.notion.site/ao3-tutorial/how-to-use-ao3-9b25a11bb6aa46f9890ef34f349d6188" target="_blank">Notion</a> <i class="nf nf-oct-link_external"></i> to help my friends use the site and I'm currently in the process of re-working it into HTML so I can add it here. This guide started on Google Docs before I moved it to Notion. Google Docs is y'know Google Docs and is quite limited in what you can do with it, Notion is a lot better and was easy for my friends to access but I don't want to have to rely on it just to make a decent guide. HTML can do everything I want and more plus you can add way more styling. I didn't have this site when I made that guide but now I do so I can do what I want!</p>
            <p>It would be much easier and quicker to just transfer the notion site beat-by-beat but I want to improve it as well in terms of how its layed out and how you find what you're actually for.</p>
