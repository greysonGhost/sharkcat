                before i say anything, im using cringe to make fun of myself in a joking way. if you relate to any of
                what i say, youre not cringe, im just going through it. <br>
                <br>
                
                <a id="non-human"><b>Non-Humanity</b></a><br>
                i am so disconnected from reality to the point where i don't want to be human anymore (or feel human but im more unsure about that).
                ive looked into therian and otherkin concepts and i kind of relate but also not really. i might be experiencing all this because im 
                trans and being trans can be a lot sometimes with needing to medically transition, deal with names + pronouns, having to come out to
                every new person you meet cause you don't come off as your gender to others who dont know you yet, etc, etc, etc (i could type an essay rn).
                ive <a href="https://alterhuman-dictionary.neocities.org">found some terms</a> that i relate to such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>copinglink: <em>A voluntary identity with or as a nonhuman or fictional entity in order to cope with stress, trauma, mental illness, or something else.</em></li>
                    <li>otherhearted: <em>Having a strong connection to a species, as opposed to identifying as one. '-hearted' is used in a similar way to '-kin'; as a suffix with the name of a creature to indicate what type of otherheart a being is. A synonym for kith and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>kin for fun (kff): <em>Describes those who voluntarily identify as otherkin for fun.</em></li>
                    <li>kith: <em>When a person experiences a strong connection and/or bond with a non human species. A synonym for otherhearted and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>synpath: <em>To identify with, but not as, something. A synonym of kith and otherhearted.</em></li>
                </ul>
                like i am just a little orange/brown cat meant to be wondering around a forest instead of a human who has to deal with human life. i am 
                just a little guy do not force me to be human.<br>
                <br>
                i feel like it/its pronouns are under utilised. i say this as a he/it, but why did we invite gendered pronouns. we use it/its to refer
                to animals despite them having differing sexes. "look at that tiger, /its/ sleeping in the grass" or "this is my dog, /its/ being annoying."
                we more commonly use gender pronouns for pets because we know that sex they are, and it just makes sense or something but for all non-pets?
                for the most part we would just use it/its. what makes humans so different that we need that distinction. at what point in ancient history
                did language evolve so that we must gender everything. i dont think humans are better than animals, i truly dont. we are on the same level 
                and just because we advanced technologically and created our own standards, all other animals must suffer and so many species end up stigmatised
                because of it. if someones pet snake got loose suddenly people are calling for the banning of all snakes but you dont see the same reaction for dogs. unless a 
                dog bit someone, then that dog needs to be put down because they are a "danger to society". who decided that? the dog was acting on instinct. why are
                human lives more important. i might be hypocritical because i'm not vegan or anything while still believing that the meat industry is all kinds 
                of fucked up but hey, we live in a society.<br>
                <br>
                this was a long tangent just to explain why i like it/its. it/its pronouns remove all fucked up aspects
                of gender and humanity we have created. its a way of being more grounded more me. i am not part of this collective, i am my own thing. i'm willingly
                alligning myself with animals because it makes sense. humans are animals. we are all animals so why not embrace that? <br>
                <br>
                and what is being "human" anyway? just belonging to the species homo sapiens or is it a mental thing? our ability to use cognitive thinking? that we
                can use opposable thumbs? the stupid reason that we can love? dogs can love. cats can love.<br>
                <blockquote>"romantic love does not make someone human" - aromantics as a whole</blockquote>
                one of my online friends said recently that, to vaguely quote: "being gay and/or trans is a mental illness, not in a homophobic way but a scientific way because it 
                doesnt make sense in terms of how life is created or for someone to feel like they're something else". first of all: /heavy/ disagree to everything that was just
                said. we should not be holding ourselves to heternormative concepts. the point of existence is /not/ to create more life, its to be happy with what you do and to be
                yourself. <br>
                <br>


                <a id="age-dreaming"><b>Age Dreaming</b></a><br>
                ////non-sexual, dont get it twisted////<br>
                so we all know age regression, right? mentally regressing to a younger age (either voluntarily or involuntarily) to deal with stress, trauma, 
                etc, etc. While regressed you are mentally a child. You can learn more <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/age-regression">here</a>.
                i dont regress but i still crave to be a child again because i didnt get to experience the typical male childhood i wouldve liked (fuck being 
                trans i hate this shit (not really its just a lot)) so my brain is just like "what if you just did that now and just hoard hot wheels and stuffed 
                animals you dont need". so i just have a bunch of hot wheels lining my shelves and stuffed animals on my bed. age dreaming, for me at least, is similar to age regression
                but instead of having the mindset of a child youre just pretty much playing pretend and letting yourself act like a child. my brain hasnt actully reverted to a 5 
                year old but i /am/ letting myself watch bluey with a baby blanket while hugging a stuffed animal and sucking my thumb cause i dont have a dummy/paci (i really
                want one tho :( and i want to make it the little prince (2010) themed)
