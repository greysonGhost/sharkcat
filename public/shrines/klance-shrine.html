                klance somehow managed to rewrite my brain chemistry somehow cause i first
                watched voltron back in like 2018 just before season 6 released and here i am 4-5 
                years later with an addiction to klance. they mean everything to me. they
                kickstarted my fanfiction addiction. there were other ships i was interested in 
                reading but klance won out and dragged me into fanfiction hell.

                they compliment each other so well. they are the definition of opposites attract.
                keith is impulsive and rushes into things while lance is more level headed and thinks
                things through but they can also flip and have the opposite dynamic and they turned a
                rivalry between the two into healthy competition and its just so nice to watch play out.
                <br>
                <br>
                the bonding moment, that one gameshow moment, and the sunset scence literally created romance
                i dont make the rules. you're telling me that they look at each other with
                those fond-ass expressions and they arent hopelessly in love with each other??
                they are dating, they are husbands, they are soulmates
