                    CAUSE ITS A MOVIE NOW ON NETFLIX AND YOU SHOULD GO WATCH IT ITS REALLY GOOD I PROMISE

                    okay but seriously, nimona, where do i begin. the fact that it's first and foremost one of the best graphic novels
                    i've ever read and is pretty much my favourite of all time? its beautifully drawn, /escpecially/ during /those/
                    scenes at the end (if you've read it you know what i mean). all the characters are all so loveable (except the director
                    (the director can do die)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    nimona (the character and the graphic novel) is the trans agenda. its transgender. the author is literally trans and 
                    <a href="https://www.imfineimfine.com/p/hindsight">said so.</a> shes so trans its insane. you could not make a more trans character.
                    the recurring theme in the movie where shes talking about how her shapeshifting is still her i wanted to sob. shes so me.<br>

                    Nimona: Normal?<br>
                    Ballister: I just think it'd be easier if you were a girl<br>
                    Nimona: Easier to be a girl? You're hilarious<br>
                    Ballister: I mean, easier if you look human<br>
                    Nimona: Easier for who?<br>
                    Ballister: For you. A lot of people aren't as accepting as me<br>
                    Nimona: Mm-hmm?<br>
                    Ballister: How did you get like this?<br>
                    Nimona: What? You mean awesome?<br>
                    Ballister: No, how do you-- I'm just trying to understand what I'm working with here<br>
