            <p>okay but seriously, nimona, where do i begin. the fact that it's first and foremost one of the best graphic novels i've ever read and is pretty much my favourite of all time? its beautifully drawn, /escpecially/ during /those/ scenes at the end (if you've read it you know what i mean). all the characters are all so loveable (except the director (the director can do die)).</p>
            <p>nimona (the character and the graphic novel) is the trans agenda. its transgender. the author is literally trans and said so. shes so trans its insane. you could not make a more trans character. the recurring theme in the movie where shes talking about how her shapeshifting is still her i wanted to sob. shes so me.</p>

                Nimona: Normal?<br>
                Ballister: I just think it'd be easier if you were a girl<br>
                Nimona: Easier to be a girl? You're hilarious<br>
                Ballister: I mean, easier if you look human<br>
                Nimona: Easier for who?<br>
                Ballister: For you. A lot of people aren't as accepting as me<br>
                Nimona: Mm-hmm?<br>
                Ballister: How did you get like this?<br>
                Nimona: What? You mean awesome?<br>
                Ballister: No, how do you-- I'm just trying to understand what I'm working with here<br>
                Nimona: I'm Nimona
