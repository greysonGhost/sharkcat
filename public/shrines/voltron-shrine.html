                voltron first premiered back in 2016. i started watching in 2018 just before
                season 6 released, and the show ended in 2018. it is now 2023 and it still
                somehow lives rent free in my mind.<br>
                <br>
                if i had known back then that i would spend the next 4-5 years of my life
                obsessing over a kids tv show about giant space robot cats, i wouldve decided to not
                watch it. but here we fucking are.<br>
                <br>
                4 teenagers + 1 tired 20 something end up in outer space through the power of a blue lion
                and a wormhole. they find a castle with 2 random aliens called alteans. shenanigans and
                an intergalactic war ensue. such a banger fucking premise yet the last two seasons went to
                complete shit AND ITS STILL ONE OF MY TOP SHOWS OF ALL TIME. HOW? I WILL NEVER KNOW. I
                OWN THE FIRST 2 SEASONS ON DVD AND I WANNA GET THE REST OF 4-6 CAUSE 7-8 DIDNT GET A 
                DVD RELEASE. I LOVE THE DUMBASS CHARACTERS SO FUCKING MUCH.<br>
                <br>
                fanfictions i love more than life itself (most of these are gonna be klance):<br>

                <br>
                the fact that voltron is set in space where its a normal plot point to meet some random aliens
                with different cultures means theres so much potential for really interesting fanfics. 
                you need a very specific plot? aliens. problem fucking solved. and its so fucking good every
                single time. i eat that shit up.
