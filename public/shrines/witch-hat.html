            <p>god, where do i begin? the breathtaking art? the characters? the insane worldbuilding? the fact that its a witch story that actually touches on the consequences if only one part of society being able to do magic? the hot men?</p>
            <p>i've essentially based my entire layout off this manga (see: banner, pagedoll, general vibe) because i love this series so much and because of how much it means to me. i've been following it for i wanna say a couple years now and still every time it updates i get so happy.</p>
            <p>a 12 year old girl called Coco has wanted to be a witch ever since she was a young child but she wasn't born a witch so she can't do magic. that is, at least, until she meets a witch called Qiifrey. Coco ends up learning from spying on Qifrey that instead of being born with magic you have to draw glyphs. Knowing this fact she ends up doing a few spells but one of them turns awry and her mother ends up turning to stone with Qifrey saving Coco just in time. Qifrey ends up taking Coco under his wing (for personal gain at first lets be honest he is a morally grey and i love that about him (i can fix him)) and throughout the series she learns about magic and how witch society is run.</p>
            <p>the tl;dr of the series is Coco discovers magic, learns magic, and the most exterme moral questions about whether or not the secret of magic should be revealed to the rest of society and what implications the arguments from both sides have. I AGREE WITH THE "VILLAINS" THATS THE SORT OF STORY GOING ON HERE AND I LOVE IT TO PIECES.</p>
