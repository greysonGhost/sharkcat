                how magic stories should be done. i am so serious i need more of this. let me inject it into my veins

                god, where do i begin? the breathtaking art? the characters? the insane worldbuilding? the fact that its a witch
                story that actually touches on the consequences if only one part of society being able to do magic? the hot men?<br>
                <br>
                i've essentially based my entire layout off this manga (see: banner, pagedoll, general vibe) because i love this series
                so much and because of how much it means to me. i've been following it for i wanna say a couple years now and still every time
                it updates i get so happy. <br>
                <br>
                a 12 year old girl called Coco has wanted to be a witch ever since she was a young child but she wasn't born a witch so she can't do magic.
                that is, at least, until she meets a witch called Qiifrey. Coco ends up learning from spying on Qifrey that instead of
                being born with magic you have to draw glyphs. Knowing this fact she ends up doing a few spells but one of them turns awry
                and her mother ends up turning to stone with Qifrey saving Coco just in time. Qifrey ends up taking Coco under his wing
                (for personal gain at first lets be honest he is a morally grey and i love that about him (i can fix him)) and throughout
                the series she learns about magic and how witch society is run.<br>
                <br>
                the tl;dr of the series is Coco discovers magic, learns magic, and the most exterme moral questions about whether or not the secret
                of magic should be revealed to the rest of society and what implications the arguments from both sides have. I AGREE WITH THE "VILLAINS"
                THATS THE SORT OF STORY GOING ON HERE AND I LOVE IT TO PIECES.<br>

                me ranting about harry potter:<br>
                it's everything that harry potter could've been and more. shirahama could've written harry potter
                but joanne could never even aspire to create anything as beautiful and wonderful as witch hat atelier. i don't want to compare the 
                two series (it would be an insult to witch hat atelier) but its hard not to when one is essentially a global phenomenon thats
                worth billions while the author is a piece of shit and the other is a lesser known but still popular manga getting an anime adaption
                and the author actually cares for people's rights. im not upset but witch hat deserves so much. -->
