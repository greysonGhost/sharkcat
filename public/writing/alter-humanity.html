                I am so disconnected from reality to the point where I don’t want to be human anymore  (or feel human all that much). I’ve looked into therian 
                and otherkin concepts and I can kind of relate to them? I wouldn’t call myself a therian or anything like that more that I find comfort in relating 
                to animals more than humans and it feels more correct to view myself living an animal life. I’ve <a href=“https://alterhuman-dictionary.neocities.org”>found some terms</a> 
                that I relate to such as:<br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>copinglink: <em>A voluntary identity with or as a nonhuman or fictional entity in order to cope with stress, trauma, mental illness, or something else.</em></li>
                    <li>otherhearted: <em>Having a strong connection to a species, as opposed to identifying as one. '-hearted' is used in a similar way to '-kin'; as a suffix with the name of a creature to indicate what type of otherheart a being is. A synonym for kith and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>kin for fun (kff): <em>Describes those who voluntarily identify as otherkin for fun.</em></li>
                    <li>kith: <em>When a person experiences a strong connection and/or bond with a non human species. A synonym for otherhearted and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>synpath: <em>To identify with, but not as, something. A synonym of kith and otherhearted.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                And those all essentially match what I’m experiencing. I don’t think I’m an animal stuck in a human body or think I had a past life as an animal 
                or any of the other explanations that therians and otherkin use to explain their own experiences. I just think I would be better off mentally if 
                I was just a little wild cat wondering around a forest instead of having to be human and do human things. I am just a little guy forced to be human 
                against my will.<br>
                <br>
                I think this is also why I like it/its pronouns (not exclusively because I would never be taken seriously and he/him is a vibe). I am just a thing,
                a creature, something so grotesque you can’t even tell what it is. And it/its pronouns in general are so fucking cool. The 
                <a href=“https://www.wordnik.com/words/it”>definition</a> of ‘it’ is:<br>
                <blockquote>Used to refer to that one previously mentioned. Used of a nonhuman entity; an animate being whose sex is unspecified, unknown, or 
                irrelevant; a group of objects or individuals; an action; or an abstraction.</blockquote>
                <br>
                At what point in human history did we decide that gendered pronouns were needed. At what point did we decide that humanity was more important than 
                animals that we needed to distinguish ourselves from them. What makes humans so different. I don’t think that humans are better or superior than animals, 
                I truly don’t. We are all equal. Just because we up and decided that we are morally superior to all animals in existence so many animals end up suffering 
                and end up stigmatised to hell and back because of it. If someones pet snake got loose suddenly people are calling for the banning of all snakes but you 
                don’t see the same reaction for dogs. If a shark bit and killed someone then we need to start fearing for our lives and all sharks are dangerous and they 
                need to be eradicated. Motherfucker, you choose to swim in the ocean. Thats its fucking home. You choose to accept the risks. Humans are not aquatic beings. 
                And even pets such as dogs can be treated like shit. If a dog bit someone hard enough to cause harm for whatever reason, then people start saying that the 
                dogs need to be put down because its a “danger to society”. The dog was acting on instinct. Chances are it was because of humans that made it aggressive. 
                Why does the dog have to suffer for humanities mistakes? Who decided that? Why are human lives more important.<br>
                <br>
                This was just a long tangent to explain why I like it/its pronouns. They remove all fucked up aspects of humanity. Its grounding for me. I am not part of 
                this collective. I am my own thing. I am willingly aligning myself with animals because it makes sense. Humans are animals so why not embrace that? And what 
                is “being human” anyway? Just belonging to the species homo sapiens? Our ability to use cognitive thinking? That we have opposable thumbs? That we can 
                experience love? Having love be a reason we are human is complete bullshit by the way. Dogs can love, cats can love. And if we’re talking about romantic love 
                then just fuck all aromantic people I guess. And asexuals by association.<br>
                <blockquote>“Romantic love does not make someone human” – Aromantics as a whole.</blockquote>
                One of my online, not so much anymore, “friends” said recently that, to vaguely quote: “Being gay and/or trans is a mental illness. Not in a homophobic way 
                but a scientific way because it doesn’t make sense in terms of how life is created or for someone to feel like they’re something else.” First of fucking all: 
                <em>Heavy</em> disagree to just all of that. Yes, being gay/trans is a mental thing but that doesn’t mean its not a correct way of being. I get where they were 
                coming from but saying things like that just invites bigots to justify why all queer people should be killed off. We shouldn’t be holding ourselves to 
                heteronormative concepts. The point of existence is to be happy with yourself and what you do.<br>
                <br>
                I’m trying to figure out why I may be feeling all of this. Feeling disconnected from humanity. And I think it’s partly because I’m trans. Being trans is a lot 
                to deal with on a good day let alone trying to deal with transitioning while everyone else is going on with their lives around you. You feel stunted from your 
                peers. You have to come out to everyone you already know, come out to everyone you don’t know because you don’t pass the way you want to, medically transitioning, 
                legal shit, etc, etc. Its so much to deal with at once and you have no choice but to deal with it because being trans isn’t something you can just hide form 
                everyone else, you <em>have</em> to tell people. So I think that all of this is making me feel overwhelmed and not want to be human because if I was just a cat or 
                something I wouldn’t have to deal with all this and I could just live a painless existence just existing without having to factor 50 things into my life that others don’t.<br>
                <br>
                I may not know whats going on 100% but wearing a tail helps combat the symptoms and I’m choosing to just go with it.
