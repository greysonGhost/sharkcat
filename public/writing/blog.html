                for a capitalistic society, getting a job is really fucking difficult. why is it the norm that you
                can apply for 50 jobs and only get accepted for 1 and rejected or just never get a response from the 
                rest. i need the money, companies need workers, so whats the issue here? "improve your resume", "email
                back so it gets their attention", "get better at interviews". yeah thats all well and good but why do i
                have to do all of that just so i can have some independence and live my fucking life. if you dont have a 
                job you're just fucked over. good luck doing anything with your life. and what about people like me that
                have issues doing well at job interviews? what are we supposed to do? for all the past job interviews
                i have gotten i've gotten so stressed that i started crying before i had to leave to go there 
                and ended up not going. im aware that its an issue and that i need to get over myself and just do it
                but that is a very fucking difficult mental hurdle for me to get over. and because of my innability to do
                that am i just supposed to live with my parents for the rest of my life? i want independence but i cant
                get it. for the one job ive had in the past they threw me into the deep end. thats not a good way for me 
                to learn how to do things but fuck me i guess.

                i have been thinking about my identity alot recently. i identity as a trans guy
                and i am currently on testosterone and i love it, its the best decision i've ever made.
                i fall into the binary more than the non binary but i also fuck with gender queerness. yes
                i am a dude but in a queer way y'know?<br><br>
                i collect flags like they're pokemon.<br>
                you could condense these down to like 2 flags but they are all pretty and i want to show them off<br>
