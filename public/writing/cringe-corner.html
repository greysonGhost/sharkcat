                before i say anything, im using cringe to make fun of myself in a joking way. if you relate to any of
                what i say, youre not cringe, im just going through it. <br>
                <br>
                
                <a id="non-human"><b>Non-Humanity</b></a><br>
                i am so disconnected from reality to the point where i don't want to be human anymore (or feel human but im more unsure about that).
                ive looked into therian and otherkin concepts and i kind of relate but also not really. i might be experiencing all this because im 
                trans and being trans can be a lot sometimes with needing to medically transition, deal with names + pronouns, having to come out to
                every new person you meet cause you don't come off as your gender to others who dont know you yet, etc, etc, etc (i could type an essay rn).
                ive <a href="https://alterhuman-dictionary.neocities.org">found some terms</a> that i relate to such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>copinglink: <em>A voluntary identity with or as a nonhuman or fictional entity in order to cope with stress, trauma, mental illness, or something else.</em></li>
                    <li>otherhearted: <em>Having a strong connection to a species, as opposed to identifying as one. '-hearted' is used in a similar way to '-kin'; as a suffix with the name of a creature to indicate what type of otherheart a being is. A synonym for kith and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>kin for fun (kff): <em>Describes those who voluntarily identify as otherkin for fun.</em></li>
                    <li>kith: <em>When a person experiences a strong connection and/or bond with a non human species. A synonym for otherhearted and synpath.</em></li>
                    <li>synpath: <em>To identify with, but not as, something. A synonym of kith and otherhearted.</em></li>
                </ul>
                like i am just a little orange/brown cat meant to be wondering around a forest instead of a human who has to deal with human life. I AM JUST A LITTLE GUY DO NOT FORCE ME TO BE HUMAN<br>

                so we all know age regression, right? mentally regressing to a younger age (either voluntarily or involuntarily) to deal with stress, trauma, 
                etc, etc. While regressed you are mentally a child. You can learn more <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/age-regression">here</a>.
                i dont regress but i still crave to be a child again because i didnt get to experience the typical male childhood i wouldve liked (fuck being 
                trans i hate this shit (not really its just a lot)) so my brain is just like "what if you just did that now and just hoard hot wheels and stuffed 
                animals you dont need". so i just have a bunch of hot wheels lining my shelves and stuffed animals on my bed. age dreaming, for me at least, is similar to age regression
                but instead of having the mindset of a child youre just pretty much playing pretend and letting yourself act like a child. my brain hasnt actully reverted to a 5 
                year old but i /am/ letting myself watch bluey with a baby blanket while hugging a stuffed animal and sucking my thumb cause i dont have a dummy/paci (i really
                want one tho :( and i want to make it the little prince (2010) themed)
